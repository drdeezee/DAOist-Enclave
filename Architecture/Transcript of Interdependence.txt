Now we can give final attention to operation of Social-Alignment (H3) and Social-Equilibrium (H5) in the perceptions of the whole of the Organism.

Each of the bilateral constructs (Tribal + Teamal) rest upon a balance weighing Belonging against Conviction and measuring the Interdependence of the whole Collective. In every nuance of Executive and Strategic decision making, the balance shifts slightly. With every challenge of an environmental change (both internal and external) the scale is moved and must be adjusted. The freedom of the Market system and the security of the Social System are mutually exclusive on pressing for independence and the other for dependence and the one factor that settles the conflict is the Collective Purposefulness. If indeed there is Social-Alignment within the individual as a member of the Collective, then Social-Equilibrium comes easily as a manifestation of the Soul of the Collective.

In conclusion, because every individual member (cell of the body) is both part of the Tribal and Teamal constructs, because each vote is weighted by the merit of its Purpose and there is no central authority, the whole Collective is made Agile. Because of the distinct separation[?] of Strategic authority (How things get done) from Executive (What to do), teams of one or more are made Adaptive, vested with the power to innovate.

Because the whole of the AABE Framework is constructed with fractal components that are inherent in all Humans and the building blocks of those components are Axioms of Humanity, its function is not effected by size. Therefore the governing factor - setting scale of the Collective - is demand for its product.

Because the Cultural Definition is encoded immutably[?], any position of the Collective indicating to a significantly different business purpose will naturally separate from the body forming into a distinct new AABE-Entity.
